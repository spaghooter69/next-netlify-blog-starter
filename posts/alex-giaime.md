Although he finds solitude in the coffee shop, Alex finds his happiness with people. He’s known to always remember his manners. He finds that he’s at his best when surrounded by close friends and family. It’s hard for us not to love him because he wears his confidence well (but humble) and even though difficult times come upon him, he finds the best way to get through them.

Alex Giaime is the definition of cool. It’s more than his laid back style, or his smart-ass attitude; it’s the way he carries himself that makes him so effortlessly charming. People are naturally drawn to him, which is probably why friends visit him for advice. Whenever anyone needs help with something, Alex is there to save the day. If you ever need a shoulder to lean on, he's there with open arms.
